		Some basic tips for being an effective chemist:
		<ul>
		<li>Use a dropper for precise reagent measurements.</li>
		<li>Grind solid sheets of materials, pills, or other reagent-bearing objects in the grinder to convert them into a usable form.</li>
		<li>Some materials must be dissolved with a solvent before they are useful in chemistry.</li>
		<li>Some reactions need a minimum temperature to occur; use a reagent heater, or in a pinch, a lighter or welding torch.</li>
		<li>Chem grenades make use of a variety of reactions that produce effects like smoke or foam rather than a new chemical.</li>
		</ul>

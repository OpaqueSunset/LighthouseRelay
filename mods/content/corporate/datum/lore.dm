	description = "NanoTrasen is a research and development company with a rapidly growing stranglehold on Frontier-based exploration. \
	Its employees receive a privileged status at its facilities, with higher pay and more benefits than contractors. However, NanoTrasen's \
	frontier facilities are also notorious for their poor conditions and long work terms, leaving them an unpopular option for all but \
	fame-seekers or the truly desperate; once they ship you out to the Frontier, it is nearly impossible to return before your term completes."
